Scikit-learn enhancement proposals
==================================

This repository is for structured discussions about large modifications or
additions to scikit-learn.

The discussions must create an "enhancement proposal", similar Python
enhancement proposal, that reflects the major arguments to keep in mind, the
rational and usecases that are addressed, the problems and the major
possible solution. It should be a summary of the key points that drive the
decision, and ideally converge to a draft of an API or object to be
implemented in scikit-learn.
